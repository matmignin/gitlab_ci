# This will be testing out IaC using a stack of 
  - Terraform : Create and magane resources
  - Ansible provision EC2 instance
  - Terraform Ansile Provisioner: run ansible playbooks straight out of Terraform
  - GitLab CI: automate the execution of terraform with GitLab CI pipelines
  - docker


- terraform is flexible with layout, but ansible is not
  - The SWS credentials will be set up as enfironment Variables
